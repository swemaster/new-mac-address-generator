This script generates and sets a new mac addess for my linux computer. Please note that to use it on your device you might need to change the wireless interface (wlo1 is the one on my computer) and also it kept my permanent mac address so this needs to be fixed.

# How to run

run this command in terminal

`bash changemacaddr.sh`
